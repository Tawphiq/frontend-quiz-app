## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was my first time building an application with TypeScript. It was a great learning experience that improved my understanding of static type checking and how it enhances code quality and maintainability. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Type Safety**: Using TypeScript helped catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime, making the development process smoother.
2. **Interfaces and Types**: Defining interfaces for my components and props improved the clarity of my code.
3. **Integration with React**: I learned how to integrate TypeScript with React, especially in functional components and hooks.


### Useful resources

- [React TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/) - This helped me with TypeScript patterns and best practices in React.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This is an amazing resource for quickly styling the application using utility-first CSS.
